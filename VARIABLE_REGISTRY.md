# Variable Registry by Methodology

Use this registry to maintain consistent variable symbols, names, and definitions across methodologies. Add a section for each methodology as it is developed and document the variables used.

## Template

### Methodology: `<Methodology Number or Name>`

| Symbol | Variable Name | Definition | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
|        |               |            |       |

Include any relevant notes about units, data sources, or calculation nuances in the **Notes** column. Repeat the table for additional methodologies as needed.

### Methodology: AMS-I.A

| Symbol | Variable Name | Definition | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| EG_{y} | Electricity generation | Annual electricity generated by the renewable system (kWh) | Input data collected per user |
| BE_{y} | Baseline emissions | Product of baseline generation and grid emission factor (tCO2e) | Equation (2) |
| PE_{y} | Project emissions | Emissions from the project technology (tCO2e) | Typically assumed zero |
| ER_{y} | Emission reductions | Difference between baseline and project emissions (tCO2e) | Equation (4) |
| EF_{grid} | Grid emission factor | Emission factor representing displaced electricity (tCO2e/kWh) | Derived from national data |

### Methodology: AMS-I.B

| Symbol | Variable Name | Definition | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| FC_{i,y} | Fuel consumption | Quantity of fossil fuel consumed by baseline equipment (L or kg) | Index \(i\) for fuel type |
| NCV_{i} | Net calorific value | Energy content of fuel \(i\) (MJ per unit) | Used to convert fuel to energy |
| Q_{BL,y} | Baseline energy | Fossil energy demand for the mechanical service (MJ) | Equation (1) |
| EF_{BL} | Baseline emission factor | Emission factor applied to baseline energy (tCO2e/MJ) | Derived from IPCC defaults |
| Q_{PR,y} | Project fossil energy | Residual fossil energy consumption after project implementation (MJ) | Optional input |
| BE_{y} | Baseline emissions | Product of \(Q_{BL,y}\) and \(EF_{BL}\) (tCO2e) | Equation (2) |
| PE_{y} | Project emissions | Product of \(Q_{PR,y}\) and project emission factor (tCO2e) | Equation (3) |
| ER_{y} | Emission reductions | \(BE_{y} - PE_{y}\) (tCO2e) | Equation (4) |
