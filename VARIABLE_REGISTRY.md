# Variable Registry by Methodology

Use this registry to maintain consistent variable symbols, names, and definitions across methodologies. Add a section for each methodology as it is developed and document the variables used.

## Template

### Methodology: `<Methodology Number or Name>`

| Symbol | Variable Name | Definition | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
|        |               |            |       |

Include any relevant notes about units, data sources, or calculation nuances in the **Notes** column. Repeat the table for additional methodologies as needed.

### Methodology: AMS-I.A

| Symbol | Variable Name | Definition | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| EG_{y} | Electricity generation | Annual electricity generated by the renewable system (kWh) | Input data collected per user |
| BE_{y} | Baseline emissions | Product of baseline generation and grid emission factor (tCO2e) | Equation (2) |
| PE_{y} | Project emissions | Emissions from the project technology (tCO2e) | Typically assumed zero |
| ER_{y} | Emission reductions | Difference between baseline and project emissions (tCO2e) | Equation (4) |
| EF_{grid} | Grid emission factor | Emission factor representing displaced electricity (tCO2e/kWh) | Derived from national data |
