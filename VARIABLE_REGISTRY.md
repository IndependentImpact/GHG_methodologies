# Variable Registry by Methodology

Use this registry to maintain consistent variable symbols, names, and definitions across methodologies. Add a section for each methodology as it is developed and document the variables used.

## Template

### Methodology: `<Methodology Number or Name>`

| Symbol | Variable Name | Definition | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
|        |               |            |       |

Include any relevant notes about units, data sources, or calculation nuances in the **Notes** column. Repeat the table for additional methodologies as needed.
