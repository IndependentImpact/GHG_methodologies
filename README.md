# Top 10 CDM Methodologies by Number of Projects (with links to official documents)

## Notes & caveats

- The **ACM0012 “Waste energy recovery” v6.0** is a consolidated methodology that supersedes several older “AM0012” variants and related methods. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Some of the original “AM0xxx” methodologies have been withdrawn, superseded, or merged into consolidated methodologies, and therefore their “latest version” may be archived or not actively maintained.  
- The UNFCCC CDM “Approved Baseline and Monitoring Methodologies” catalogue is the overarching repository for approved methodologies and their tools. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- For some methodologies, only older or historical versions can be found in the UNFCCC database, especially if they are no longer active.  
- You may consult the **CDM Methodology Booklet (latest edition)** as a compiled reference for methodologies and their status. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

If you like, I can dig further and retrieve pdfs or archived versions of missing methodologies (AM0001, AM0007, etc.), and give you a complete markdown file with all working links. Do you want me to do that?
